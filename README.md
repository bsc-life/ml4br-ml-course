## Day 3 â€“ Deep Learning

Part I: The world of Deep Learning
- Differences between Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Deep Dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Deep Learning frameworks: PyTorch and fast.ai
- Hands-on overview of the DL applications: image classification, image segmentation, text classification, tabular data, collaborative filtering (recommendation systems)
- SHAP values for explainability

Part II: Neural Networks Dive-In
- A Neural Network at Work
- How do Neural Networks Learn?
- Limitations
- Introduction to Pytorch:
- A Basic Neural Network
- Binary Classification of Tabular Data
- Binary Classification of Images

Requirements (Optional, if we have time for thatâ€¦):
- Register for a free version of ChatGPT (or alternatives like Claude, DeepSeek, etc.) to cover LLMs prompting for software development
- If you want to run an image classifier on your data, upload images to your Google Drive. Preferred structure of the dataset - each image class sits in its own folder.

## Day 4 â€“ Large Language Models from Theory to Applications

Throughout the four hours, weâ€™ll explore the core ideas behind Large Language Models (LLMs), breaking down the foundational principles of the Transformer architecture and the attention mechanism that powers them. Along the way, weâ€™ll examine both the strengths and limitations of these models, including the challenges of scaling them to real-world applications. We will conclude the day with a demo of the hugging face transformers library and a practical exercise of fine-tuning a large language model on a collection of life-sciences inspired NLP problems.
